# Hangman

This is the code for a hangman game I have written in C++.
Currently allows for one player to enter the answer and another to guess afterwards.

There are several areas where the program can be improved, such as:
  1) Allowing the use of backspace when entering the answer
  2) Restricting answers to only include letters

Expanding the program could be achieved by:
  1) Allowing a one-player mode by selecting a word from an online dictionary
  2) Refreshing the terminal after each guess (OS specific)
